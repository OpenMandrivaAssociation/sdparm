%description
SCSI disk parameters are held in mode pages. This utility lists or
changes those parameters. Other SCSI devices (or devices that use
the SCSI command set) such as CD/DVD and tape drives may also find
parts of sdparm useful. Requires the linux kernel 2.4 series or later.
In the 2.4 series SCSI generic device names (e.g. /dev/sg0)
must be used. In the 2.6 series other device names may be used as
well (e.g. /dev/sda).

Warning: It is possible (but unlikely) to change SCSI disk settings
that stop or slow it down. Use with care.
